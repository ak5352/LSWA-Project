# LSWA-Project
NY Restaurant Sanitation Lookup

## Things that need to be done in the backend:

1. Output a table of restaurants underneath where the user hits the search button
2. Each restaurant should have a button next to it that says "This restaurant made me sick"
3a. If the user is logged in, they should be able to hit that button and add that restaurant to their table
3b. Otherwise, the button should redirect them to the login page
4. Each restaurant should have a border color that corresponds with its sickness count. Red = high, Yellow = medium, Green = low
5a. If a logged in user clicks on "Dashboard", he or she should be able to access the restaurants that made him/her sick
5b. Otherwise, the dashboard should lead the user to the login page
